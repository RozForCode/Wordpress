- Some extra security plugins - WP FA2 - login, limit login, admin login url change, inactive logout plugin, wordfence(malware scanning), backup plugins
- Sever-side projection
- Disable PHP Error Reporting - Add a code snippet in the wp-config.php file to hide PHP errors that might expose vulnerabilities.
